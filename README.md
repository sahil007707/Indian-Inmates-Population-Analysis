# 📊 Indian Inmates Population Analysis

## 🔎 A Data-Driven Look at India's Prison System

This project explores prison population data across Indian states and union territories. Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, we analyze patterns in incarceration related to **state**, **gender**, and **prisoner type** (convicted, under trial, detained). The aim is to uncover regional imbalances and social insights hidden in raw prison statistics.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Government datasets / public domain (CSV/Excel format)
- **Scope**: Inmate statistics by state and gender
- **Columns include**:
  - `State/UT`
  - `Male Inmates`, `Female Inmates`
  - `Convicted`, `Under Trial`, `Detained`
  - Possibly year or region (optional)

## 📊 Analysis Goals

- Identify **states with the highest and lowest inmate populations**
- Compare **gender distribution** among inmates
- Determine the proportion of **under trial vs convicted** inmates
- Visualize **regional trends** and detect statistical **outliers**
- Use EDA to reflect on **systemic and social justice issues**

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🧠 Key Findings

### 🔹 State-wise Inmate Population
- **Uttar Pradesh**, **Madhya Pradesh**, and **Maharashtra** have the largest number of inmates.
- **Delhi** shows a high prisoner count relative to its small area, identified as an outlier.

### 🔹 Gender Distribution
- Over 95% of inmates are **male**
- **Delhi** and **Maharashtra** show higher relative counts of female inmates.

### 🔹 Convicted vs Under Trial
- A **large portion of inmates** are **under trial**—not convicted.
- This reflects systemic issues with **judicial backlog** and **delays in justice**.

### 🔹 Regional Insights
- **Northern states** dominate in inmate counts.
- **Southern states** show relatively balanced prison populations.
